# Car Tracker App

This app sends the live location of the car to the database every 3 seconds.

This app resides in the device which is located inside the vehicle.

In the apps java files or string.xml wherever there is "https://car-locator-javalab-proj.000webhostapp.com/" replace it by your website name where the php files have been uploaded.

Ex: In this repository inside "Car-Locator-System/CarLocator4L/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" there are links like:

**"https://car-locator-javalab-proj.000webhostapp.com/loginA.php"**

make it:

**"https://your-example-site.com/loginA.php"**

#### Dont forget to search in the java files too 😋.
